------------

Oraculum is part MVC framework and part behavior library. As such, the architecture can be thought of as two separate sets of components. The MVC component of Oraculum is a set of definitions and mixins that emulate the behaviors of Chaplin, and from a high-level perspective, share Chaplin's MVC architecture. The behavior library component of Oraculum is a set of definitions and mixins that aims solve generic, common use case problems such as binding an element's text property to an attribute of a data model, or dynamically sorting a collection's models.
